- Use <dependencyManagement> for consistent dependency versions across modules.
- Utilize BOMs (Bill of Materials) for managing transitive dependencies.
- Adhere to the standard Maven directory layout (src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.).
- Define build profiles for environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, test, prod).
- Centralize plugin management within <pluginManagement> to ensure consistent plugin versions.
- Keep POMs readable and maintainable, using properties for version management.
- Declare custom repositories explicitly and minimize their use, preferring a central repository manager.
