  When working with Kafka consumers:
  - Configure `KafkaConsumer` properties (bootstrap servers, deserializers, group ID, auto-offset reset).
  - Implement a polling loop to fetch records.
  - Manage consumer offsets effectively (auto-commit, manual commit).
  - Handle message processing failures and potential re-processing.
  - Consider consumer group rebalancing and session timeouts.
  - Close the consumer gracefully.
