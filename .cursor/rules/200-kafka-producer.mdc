  When working with Kafka producers:
  - Ensure proper configuration of `KafkaProducer` properties (bootstrap servers, serializers, acks, retries).
  - Implement error handling for message sending (e.g., using callbacks or `Future.get()`).
  - Consider batching and compression for performance optimization.
  - Use appropriate keys for message partitioning.
  - Close the producer gracefully when no longer needed.
