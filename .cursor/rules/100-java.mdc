- Follow Google Java Format or a similar established style guide for formatting.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables (e.g., camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes).
- Provide comprehensive Javadoc comments for public classes, methods, and fields, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Avoid excessive use of magic numbers and instead define them as constants.
- Prefer immutability where possible.
- Use try-with-resources for managing resources like streams and file I/O.
